# Yubikey 4 as a GPG Smart Card

The Yubikey is a small USB token which can be used for [OTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_password), [U2F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_2nd_Factor) and [CCID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCID_(protocol))

I don't use my Yubikey for anything other than CCID as I prefer to use [Authy](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authy.authy) on my phone instead, I do however leave the OTP feature enabled so that udev gives the correct permissions to the card.
Arch provide the udev rules in the package named `yubikey-personalization`

**/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/69-yubikey.rules**
```
ACTION!="add|change", GOTO="yubico_end"

# Udev rules for letting the console user access the Yubikey USB
# device node, needed for challenge/response to work correctly.

# Yubico Yubikey II
ATTRS{idVendor}=="1050", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0010|0110|0111|0114|0116|0401|0403|0405|0407|0410", \
    ENV{ID_SECURITY_TOKEN}="1"

LABEL="yubico_end"
```

You will also need `yubikey-manager` if you want to enable touch-to-sign which protects you against malware accessing your key without you knowing.

### Setup GPG-Agent
`~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`
```
enable-ssh-support
pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-curses
default-cache-ttl 60
max-cache-ttl 120
write-env-file
use-standard-socket
```

### Generate GPG Key
```

Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) RSA and RSA (default)
   (2) DSA and Elgamal
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
Your selection? 4
RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (2048) 4096
Requested keysize is 4096 bits
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      <n>  = key expires in n days
      <n>w = key expires in n weeks
      <n>m = key expires in n months
      <n>y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) 0
Key does not expire at all
Is this correct? (y/N) y

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: Real Name
Email address: username@example.com
Comment: 
You selected this USER-ID:
    "Real Name <username@example.com>"

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? O
We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.
