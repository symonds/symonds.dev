# Yubikey 4 as a GPG Smart Card
<img src="https://www.yubico.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Yubico-logo-website.png" width="128">

The Yubikey is a small USB token which can be used for [OTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_password), [U2F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_2nd_Factor) and [CCID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCID_(protocol))

I don't use my Yubikey for anything other than CCID, I do however leave the OTP feature enabled so that udev gives the correct permissions to the card.
Arch provide the udev rules in the package named `yubikey-personalization`

**/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/69-yubikey.rules**
```
ACTION!="add|change", GOTO="yubico_end"

# Udev rules for letting the console user access the Yubikey USB
# device node, needed for challenge/response to work correctly.
